### About the Project -
The demand for NGOs' social welfare services is increasing.
Due to India's slow pace of poverty alleviation and the fact that millions of people are still living in poverty, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are attempting to fill in the gaps in the government's efforts.
NGOs have a number of critical and difficult obstacles, including a lack of trust, fierce rivalry, and the inability to promote themselves to their target audience.
